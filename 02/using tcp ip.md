# Using TCP/IP for communication
- Any time you connect to the internet, you are using TCP/IP
- Any piece of information that is being shared over the internet is using the TCP/IP suite of protocols
- If you go to google.com (or any website), you are issuing a series of TCP requests in order to get the content from the page to your PC
- you can use programs that check to see if websites are running, which use IP-encapsulated protocols
- SSH connects to a remote system using TCP/IP
- streaming music over the internet is also using the TCP/IP protocol suite
- other examples: gaming online, etc
